## About Seva Setu
We are a young, humble social initiative founded by an IIT-IIM alumnus and an ex-bureaucrat. 
Our team members include consultants, technology specialists, managers, communication & media manager and psychologists spread across India.

True to  our name, we aim to serve as an enabler, facilitator and advocate and thus, act as a bridge (Setu) between various stakeholders and resources (state/central government/concerned NGOs, corporate, young educated students & professionals) and the prospective beneficiary (poor and needy people).
Through our programs and services we wish to provide a last mile connectivity to people in ensuring transfer of benefits from the government. 
In doing so, we envision creating a problem solving society which is connected and concerned enough to solve its problems on its own, making organizations like ours become redundant in the long run.
