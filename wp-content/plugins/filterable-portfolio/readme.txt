== Description ==

A WordPress Filterable Portfolio to display portfolio images or gallery to your site.

= Usages =

After installing and activating the plugin, a new custom post type called "Portfolios" will appear at your Wordpress Admin area. Just create your Portfolio from the "Portfolios" menu & paste the following shortcode where you want to display this Portfolio:

`[filterable_portfolio thumbnail='' prettyphoto_theme='']`

The value of `thumbnail=''` can be from 1 to 6

The value of `prettyphoto_theme=''` can be default, dark_rounded, dark_square, light_rounded, light_square or facebook

So if you want to show three thumbnail with prettyphoto facebook theme, your shortcode should look like the following:

`[filterable_portfolio thumbnail='3' prettyphoto_theme='facebook']`

From plugin version 1.0.3, You can change image size by adding attribute `thumbnail_size=''`. The default value of `thumbnail_size=''` is 'full'. You can also add 'thumbnail', 'medium', 'large', 'post-thumbnail' or any custom image size that has been added by add_image_size() function. e.g.

`[filterable_portfolio thumbnail='3' prettyphoto_theme='facebook' thumbnail_size='medium']`
